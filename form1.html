        var emailBody = 'Dear Sir/Mam'+<br\>+' We thought of doing further brainstorming before reaching out to you with this email'+<br\>+'To my understanding and as mentioned in EIA 2020 in the beginning the major reasons behind introducing it over EIA 2006 is to strengthen the environmental violations and safeguard the environment. Also another important aspect was to create a system which expediets the EIA process. But somehow the EIA 2020 in its present form isnt in line with these agendas. On the onset of environmental pollution taking its toll we must by now understand that economy and environment must go hand in hand. And when it comes to the economy its more so done for the development of people of the country but interestingly while EIA 2006 had greater public consultation scope, EIA 2020 had lowered such scope. Given any condition when development is for the people and when we are in a democratic setup I am thoughtful about why we dont want greater public consultation when they are the ones who are going to have a direct impact of the environmental loss during any industrial work being carried out. When any act related to environment is amendment it is more so expected to have positive impacts on the environment and stop destruction and pollution of environment in any form but I would briefly list out some key points which raises questions on whether EIA 2020 intends to do so: %0D%0A %0D%0A  1. No solution for the political and bureaucratic stronghold on  the EIA process. Instead, it proposes to increase the government’s discretionary power and limit public engagement in safeguarding the environment. (Please refer to clause 14 (Page no. 18) of EIA 2020 and Clause 7 (i) III (Page no. 6) of EIA 2006). So many industries have been exempted from public consultation while it is the public which bears the greatest loss for the destruction of ecology and environment around them. Why is the code so rigid about seeking public consultation?.%0D%0A%0D%0A 2. Both EIA 2006 and 2020 mentions about: %0D%0A "All projects concerning national defence and security or involving other strategic considerations, as determined by the Central Government, shall require prior-EC or prior-EP, as the case may be, from the Ministry without any change in the category of the project. Further, no information relating to such projects shall be placed in public domain."%0D%0Aand defines "Border area as-%0D%0A “area falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from the Line of Actual Control with bordering countries of India.” %0D%0A That would cover much of the Northeast, the repository of the country’s richest biodiversity. %0D%0ASome examples are- %0D%0A%0D%0Aa. Dibang valley which will face 2,70,000 trees which is home to 555 species of birds, 50 mammals,117 wild orchids and 90 amphibians and reptiles.%0D%0A %0D%0A b.Dihing patkai wildlife sanctuary which is home to elephants,tigers,leopards,jungle cats,flying squirrels,sambar deer,slow loris and more.%0D%0A %0D%0A Few examples from other parts of the country include-%0D%0Aa. Goas bhagwan mahaveer wildlife sanctuary %0D%0Ab. Mollem national park.%0D%0A c. Vedanthangal bird sanctuary which is home to more than 40,000 species of migratory birds.%0D%0A  When we are amending the EIA we must clearly define and explain the strategic consideration because hereafter the government gets to decide on the  “strategic” tag which is against the FAMOUS line of DEMOCRACY Laws by the people, for the people and of the people. Additionally ”no information on “such projects shall be placed in the  public domain" which adds to the concern. Already enough destruction to the environment has been already done, the recent Assam oil well fire is one such grave example. Why is the code so rigid about seeking public consultation and where is the  environmental protection reflected?%0D%0A  %0D%0A 3. POST FACTO CLEARANCE %0D%0AA project operating in violation of the EPA can now apply for clearance which Is not so in .  EIA 2006.%0D%0A(a) Violators will only need 2 plans for remediation and resource augmentation which is 1.5-2 times the ecological damage assessed and economic benefit derived due to violation.%0D%0A   %0D%0A(b) Penalty per day of late clearance – miniscule. (Clearly refered in the word file attached along with mail). %0D%0A * 1 April 2020 - Supreme Court order held that such clearances are contrary to law. %0D%0AWho can put the Complaints for violation of EIA 2020? (Please refer to Clause 22, page no. 29, EIA 2020) %0D%0A(a) If any violations are taking place, they have to be reported by the developers themselves (suo moto). So here the reliance is on the violators to disclose, suo motu, that they broke the law. %0D%0A %0D%0A  (b) If any violations are taking place, they can be reported a government authority%0D%0A %0D%0A https://thewire.in/government/environment-impact-assessmenThere is absolutely no scope for any public complaint about violations.Why is the code so rigid about seeking public consultation and where is the sense of environmental protection reflected?%0D%0A %0D%0A 4. As per EIA 2006, the buildings of 20,000 sq.m or above required an environment clearance after detailed scrutiny by the state level expert appraisal committee, whereas according to the 2020 draft, the limit will be 150,000 Sq.m which will lead to greater amount of deforestation and mass extinctions.%0D%0A %0D%0A 5. The ministry of environment and forest didnt provide enough publicity to receive objections and suggestions from stakeholders and the public. There were and are lot of ambiguity, please find the links below-%0D%0A%0D%0A https://www.thequint.com/news/environment/javadekar-overruled-subordinates-cut-time-for-public-views-on-draft-environment-assessment-rules%0D%0A%0D%0A https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/delhi-hc-extends-time-for-filing-objections-to-draft-eia-notification-2020-till-august-11-159131%0D%0Ahttps://www.livelaw.in/environment/delhi-hc-directs-centre-to-publish-draft-eia-2020-in-22-official-languages-within-10-days-read-order-159308?infinitescroll=1%0D%0A%0D%0A Few organizations tried to do campaigns to send email and protest against EIA 2020, their website was blocked by the National internet exchange of India without stating any reason. Please find the relevant links below:%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://theprint.in/india/our-websites-blocked-say-3-environmental-groups-campaigning-against-contentious-draft-policy/460530/%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://www.vice.com/en_in/article/v7gzxb/environmental-websites-leading-the-movement-against-indias-controversial-eia-notification-2020-are-blocked%0D%0A%0D%0A 6. While one of the major intentions of EIA 2020 is to expedite there are no changes in the number of meetings to be carried out every month by any of the bodies responsible for approving the EIA. In EIA 2006 it was at least 1 meeting each month and it remains the same in EIA 2020. (Please refer to section 6 point 12, Page no. 11 of EIA 2020, section 8 point 12, Page no. 11 of EIA 2020, section 5 , Page no. 45 of EIA 2006). %0D%0A%0D%0A The list actually goes on and I would like to stop here. In  a nutshell I would conclude by saying " India is 5th most vulnerable country to climate change. By making such changes I have no hope that we will be able to meet up Paris agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius promise. Agriculture would too be affected by climate change which will be a threat to our food security. I wonder where we are heading." %0D%0A %0D%0A We are really concerned as to what we are doing to our planet and we have no planet B. We request you to withdraw EIA 2020 and reconsider several concerns with active public participation.%0D%0A %0D%0A  https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/17/pandemics-destruction-nature-un-who-legislation-trade-green-recovery?__twitter_impression=true%0D%0A%0D%0A Kind Regards';
